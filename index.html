        <p>
            My name is Anthony Carroll, I am 18 years old with very big dreams.
            I do many things in my spare time from creating artwork, playing sports, and even fixing cars.
            What I never stopped doing was messing around with computers. My family, not being the best
            financially never got the best. I usually surfed the web on the computers in libraries or the ones
            in school if I had anytime. Eventually highschool came around and a lot of computer science programs
            opened up and I dove head first. I learned python, small amount of javascript along the way. I 
            was even able to learn some HTML while learning javascript. Doing a lot with computers got me interested
            in creating wesbites and how they work. So here I am hoping to make wesbites and my own.
