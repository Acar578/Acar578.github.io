        I take pride in what I do and I always reflect on my accomplishments. It helps me learn or make 
        decisions. One I am particulary proud of is my insatiable desire to seek new things. It helped me throughout 
        my soccer career, and learning career. I would always try new things on the pitch, and try new things 
        in class. A lot of time people would say, "<i>Well, you're just making things harder for yourself</i>". But for me, 
        I was finding my own answers, and I was able to come to my own understanding.
